    OOPs is basically a style of writing a code in more organized way.
    Till now, we have been writing code in procedural way -> Functional Programming.

    Every Real World Entity are the Objects, Which will have:
    1. Properties / Attributes (Data Members)
    2. Functions / Methods (Member Functions)
    And, all of these clubbed together to form a Class(Data Type - User Defined).

    So, By definition:-
    Class: A class is a blueprint for creating the object.
    Object: An object is an instance of a class.
