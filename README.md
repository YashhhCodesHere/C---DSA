### Data Structures is a fundamental topic in computer science that involves organizing and storing data efficiently. Below are some key topics that come under Data Structures:
1. Basic Concepts
Data Types: Primitive (int, char, float, etc.) vs. Non-Primitive (arrays, lists, etc.)
Abstract Data Types (ADTs): Definition and importance.
2. Linear Data Structures
Arrays: Static vs. dynamic, operations (insertion, deletion, traversal, etc.).
Linked Lists:
Singly Linked List: Structure, operations, advantages, and limitations.
Doubly Linked List: Bi-directional traversal, operations.
Circular Linked List: Circular references, usage.
Stacks: LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure, operations (push, pop, peek), applications (e.g., expression evaluation, backtracking).
Queues: FIFO (First In, First Out) structure, operations (enqueue, dequeue), types (circular queue, priority queue, double-ended queue).
Hash Tables: Hashing, collision resolution techniques (chaining, open addressing).
3. Non-Linear Data Structures
Trees:
Binary Trees: Structure, traversal techniques (in-order, pre-order, post-order), applications.
Binary Search Trees (BST): Insertion, deletion, searching.
AVL Trees: Self-balancing BSTs, rotations, balancing factor.
Heaps: Min-heap, max-heap, heap operations (insertion, deletion), heap sort.
Trie: Prefix trees, usage in string searching, operations (insertion, deletion, searching).
Graphs:
Graph Representations: Adjacency matrix, adjacency list.
Graph Traversals: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS).
Shortest Path Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall.
Minimum Spanning Tree: Kruskal’s, Prim’s algorithms.
4. Advanced Data Structures
Segment Trees: Used in range queries, dynamic updates.
Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees): Efficient range queries.
B-Trees and B+ Trees: Self-balancing tree structures used in databases.
Red-Black Trees: Balanced binary search trees with additional constraints.
5. Complexity Analysis
Time and Space Complexity: Big-O, Big-Theta, Big-Omega notations.
Amortized Analysis: Average-case time complexity over a sequence of operations.
6. Applications of Data Structures
Searching and Sorting Algorithms: Binary search, merge sort, quicksort, etc.
Dynamic Programming: Optimal substructure, overlapping subproblems.
Greedy Algorithms: Problem-solving approach using data structures.
These topics form the core of Data Structures, and understanding them is crucial for efficient algorithm design and problem-solving in computer science.
