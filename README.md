# Striver DSA Sheet in C++

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions to the popular [Striver DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) implemented in C++. The Striver DSA Sheet is a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems that are essential for cracking coding interviews. By solving these problems, I aim to strengthen my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## About
This repository is a collection of solutions to the problems from the Striver DSA Sheet. The problems cover a wide range of topics, including arrays, linked lists, dynamic programming, trees, graphs, and more. Each solution is implemented in C++ and includes detailed comments to explain the logic behind the code.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Includes solutions to all the problems listed in the Striver DSA Sheet.
- **Well-Documented Code**: Each solution is accompanied by comments explaining the logic and approach used.
- **Optimized Solutions**: Where possible, solutions are optimized for time and space complexity.
- **Organized Structure**: Solutions are organized by topic and difficulty level, making it easy to navigate.
