    Abstraction: Hiding all unnecessary details from the user, and only showing the necessary/important details to the user.
    We're using Abstraction using 'Access Specifiers' in C++:-
        1. Public: Accessible from anywhere.
        2. Private: Accessible only within the class.
        3. Protected: Accessible within the class and its derived classes.
    We also use 'Abstract Classes' & 'Pure Virtual Functions' to achieve Abstraction.
