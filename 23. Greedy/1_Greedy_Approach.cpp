    Greedy Approach: 
    - Choose the local optimal solution at each step to find the global optimal solution.
    - It is used when the problem has the following properties:
        1. Optimal substructure: The problem can be solved using the solutions of its subproblems.
        2. Greedy choice property: The problem can be solved by making a greedy choice.
