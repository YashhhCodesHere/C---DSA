/*
    To avoid memory leak in C++ we can return the pointer from the function & store it in the main function & then we can delete the memory allocated in heap memory, or, 
    we can use 'Smart Pointers', which automatically deletes the memory allocated in heap memory.
    It is included in <memory> header file, which is a part of C++11.
    Syntax:-
    unique_ptr<int> ptr(new int);  // unique_ptr is a smart pointer which automatically deletes the memory allocated in heap memory.
