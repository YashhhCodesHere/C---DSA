/*
    Breadth First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that traverses the graph level by level.
    In general, unlike for Tree data structure, we don't have any root node in Graphs.
    Hence, we can choose any node as the starting node for traversal, which is 'Source' node.

    (We can start with any vertex, but in general we start with the vertex with the lowest value/Index.)

    BFS is very similar to Level Order Traversal of a Tree, 
    which says 'TRAVERSE TO IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS FIRST'.
