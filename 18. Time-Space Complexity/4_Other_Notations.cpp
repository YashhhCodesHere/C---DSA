/*
    Some other notation used to represent the Time Complexity of an algorithm:- (NOT Much used)
    1. Big Omega (Î©) -> Lower Bound         (Best Case Scenario)
    2. Big Theta (Î˜) -> Average Bound       (Average Case Scenario)    => (Upper Bound + Lower Bound) / 2

    - Big Oh Says that you can't find worse time complexity than this.
    - Big Omega Says that you can't find better time complexity than this.
    - Big Theta Says that you can't find better or worse time complexity than this. ( It is the tightest bound => Best Case = Worst Case )
