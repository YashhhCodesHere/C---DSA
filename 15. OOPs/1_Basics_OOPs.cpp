    OOPs is basically a style of writing a code in more organized way.
    Till now, we have been writing code in procedural way -> Functional Programming.

    Every Real World Entity are the Objects, Which will have:
    1. Properties / Attributes (Data Members)
    2. Functions / Methods (Member Functions)
    And, all of these clubbed together to form a Class(Data Type - User Defined).

    So, By definition:-
    Class: A class is a blueprint for creating the object.
    Object: An object is an instance of a class.

    Dot(.) Operator: It is used to access the Data Members/Functions of an object.
    Arrow(->) Operator: It is used to access the Data Members/Functions of a pointer to an object.
    Scope Resolution(::) Operator: It is used to access the static members of a class.
    'this' Pointer: It is a pointer which points to the current object. ex: this->name or *(this).name

int main(){
    
/*
    Encapsulation: It is the process of wrapping up of data members and member functions into a single unit called class. 
                   It also implements the Data Hiding(Using Access Modifiers).

    OOPs have 4 main pillars:-
    1. Encapsulation => Data Hiding
    2. Inheritance => Code Reusability
    3. Abstraction => Data Security
    4. Polymorphism => Flexibility

    Syntax:-

    class class_name{
    access_specifier:
            data_members;
    access_specifier:
            member_functions;
    };
